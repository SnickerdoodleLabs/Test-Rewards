# Snickerdoodle Labs Simple Testnet Reward

The project creates a vanilla ERC721 contract for use as a test reward contract. Team members can add there wallets to the `MINTER_ROLE` and 
mint rewads to their wallets for testing various functionalities of the reward stack on EVM-compatible public testnets.
